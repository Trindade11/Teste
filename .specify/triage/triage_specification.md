# Specification Backlog

> This file is managed by `/speckit.triage`. Each entry represents a feature or behavior to be processed by `/speckit.specify`.

## How it works

1. `/speckit.triage` adds entries with `status: pending`
2. `/speckit.specify` reads pending entries and creates specifications
3. After processing, status changes to `absorbed` with timestamp, agent, and reference to created spec
