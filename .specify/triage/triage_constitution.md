# Constitution Backlog

> This file is managed by `/speckit.triage`. Each entry represents a principle or rule to be absorbed by `/speckit.constitution`.

## How it works

1. `/speckit.triage` adds entries with `status: pending`
2. `/speckit.constitution` reads pending entries and incorporates them
3. After processing, status changes to `absorbed` with timestamp and agent
